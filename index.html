		<p><b> Are you looking for a self-driven passionate Developer who yearns to learn new things quickly? If so, please consider my application. I am very eager to offer my experience of programming in front-end, middle ware and back-end technologies.<br>

	I pursued my Masters in Computer Engineering from University of Cincinnati. In my Masters program, I have gained broad knowledge in Software Development, Databases, basics in Networking, writing algorithms and design principles. I have been working on number of projects during this period which highlighted my programming skills. I worked most of my projects on databases. I have worked on projects that helped me to improve my knowledge of programming in JAVA and C#. These projects helped me improve my experience in working with the front-end development.
	I worked on multiple Internships during the last two years of my bachelors. In most of my internships I worked on Java and C# with different web technologies. These Internships provided me with the ideal opportunity in analyzing, designing, implementing, integrating and testing of Java/J2EE and C# based enterprise applications. <br>

	I have taken Software Engineering courses in undergraduate and graduate studies which allowed me to know more about Testing. Such exposure to different technologies has helped me gain an overall knowledge of different frameworks. This has also helped me be versatile and stand out among others.<br>

	Coupled with unique abilities both technical and extracurricular, I think I am the right candidate for this position. I have attached my resume for your consideration. I hope that this brief introduction would allow us to meet for a more formal interview. It would be great to join your company and I would be glad to apply my skill set to fulfill my roles for this job. <br> 
I hope to interact with you soon.<br>	
Thanks<br>
